**Greetings Application**<br>
Used to create custom greetings to hotel customers using the hotel and guest data.

To create a greeting simply select a guest, hotel and template.

The template options are plain, location, reservation and create your own. The reservation option adds in the dates of the hotel stay to the greeting. The location option adds a message and the city the hotel is located in. The plain option just uses the guest's name and room number to create a simple message.  

The create your own option allows you to create a new greeting using any or none of the above features as well as the option to write your own custom messages. 

To use the established templates or the create your own template you first need to select a guest and a hotel.

There is some validation to make sure you dont forget key parts of the greeting, but the content is all up to you.
