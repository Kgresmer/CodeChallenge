**Greetings Application**    _`by Kevin Gresmer`_<br> 
This application is used to create custom greetings to hotel customers using the hotel and guest data.

To use the application go to https://kgresmer.github.io/CodeChallenge/#!/ <br>
To a create a greeting simply select a guest, hotel and template.

The template options are plain, location, reservation and create your own. The reservation option adds in the dates of the hotel stay to the greeting. The location option adds a message and the city the hotel is located in. The plain option just uses the guest's name and room number to create a simple message.  

The create your own option allows you to create a new greeting using any or none of the above features as well as the option to write your own custom messages. 

To use the established templates or the create your own template you first need to select a guest and a hotel.

There is some validation to make sure you don't forget key parts of the greeting, but the content is all up to you. 

I chose to build this application using AngularJS v1.6, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. With these languages the application is very easy to use with visual cues, written instructions, dynamic validation and immediate results.

The application was tested simply by using the app and having beta testers use the app. 

Potential improvements for the future:<br>
    - User interface could be more stimulating<br>
    - There are no animations<br>
    - There could be more options for customizing the greeting.<br>
